### General
First meeting with supervisor. Discussed basic objectives of project.

Next meeting: 20-04-2017 (Thursday, week 3)

Objectives:
* Investigate API for Parrot Bebop drone
* Collect literature on Inverse Reinforcement Learning
* Think of simple tasks for the drone

### Literature
Collected:
* Argall 2009 - A survey of robot learning from demonstration
* Stadie 2017 - Third Person Imitation Learning
* Zhang 2015 - Learning Deep Control Policies for Autonomous Aerial Vehicles with MPC-Guided Policy Search
* Finn 2016 - Guided Cost Learning: Deep Inverse Optimal Control via Policy Optimization

These papers are suggested by my supervisor.

## 19-04-2017 (Wednesday, week 3)
### General
Nothing notable happened on this day

## 20-04-2017 (Thursday, week 3)
### General
Meeting with supervisor. Discussed problem definition. Suggested two simple tasks:
* Take off and fly to a surface of a certain colour
* Fly between objects

The second task is very similar to one previously attempted. So the problem is now the first task.

The focus for the rest of the week will be on completing the literature overview. Tom suggested a couple of extra sources, which are amongst those listed in the literature section below.

Next meeting: 24-04-2017 (Monday, week 4)

Objectives:
* Investigate simulators/ROS
* (Choose papers for review)

### Literature
Collected:
* Abbeel 2004 - Apprenticeship learning via inverse reinforcement learning
* Andersson 2015 - Model-based reinforcement learning in continuous environments using real-time constrained optimization
* Ranchod 2015 - Nonparametric Bayesian Reward Segmentation for Skill Discovery
* Ross 2011 - A Reduction of Imitation Learning and Structured Prediction
to No-Regret Online Learning
* Ross 2013 - Learning monocular reactive uav control in cluttered natural environments
* Sutton 1998 - Reinforcement Learning:
An Introduction

Some of the papers may not be completely relevant to the project.

## 20-04-2017 (Friday, week 3)
### General
This simple concept map has been produces for the literature overview:

### Literature
An early version of the literature review has been written using six of the collected sources. It contains only the most relevant sources, and as such does not discuss many algorithms or applications.
